Machine learning

## Association Rule Learning\
*A technique used in data mining to discover interesting relations between variables in large databases. It involves identifying frequent patterns or associations among sets of items.*
- Apriori
- Eclat

## Classification\
*A type of supervised learning where an algorithm learns from labeled data to classify new, unseen data into different categories or classes based on their features.*
- Decision Tree Classification
- K-Nearest Neighbors(K-NN)
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine

## Clustering\
*A type of unsupervised learning where an algorithm groups similar data points together based on their features or characteristics, without any prior knowledge of the groups.*
- Hierarchical Clustering
- K-Means Clustering

## Deep Learning\
*A type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with many layers to learn complex representations of data. Deep learning has revolutionized fields such as computer vision and natural language processing.*
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Recurrent neural network (RNN)

## Dimensionality Reduction\
*A technique used to reduce the number of features or variables in a dataset while retaining as much of the original information as possible. This can help with data visualization, feature selection, and speeding up machine learning algorithms.*
- Kernel PCA
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Model Selection and Boosting\
*Model selection is the process of selecting the best machine learning model for a particular problem, while boosting is a technique used to improve the accuracy of a model by combining multiple weaker models.*
- Model Selection
- XGBoost

## Natural Language Processing\
*A field of study that focuses on the interactions between computers and human languages. NLP is used in applications such as speech recognition, language translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots.*
- Natural Language Processing

## Regression\
*A type of supervised learning where an algorithm learns to predict a continuous numerical value based on one or more predictor variables. Examples of regression algorithms include linear regression, polynomial regression, and support vector regression.*
- Polynomial Regression

## Regression model selection\
- Classification
- Regression

## Reinforcement Learning\
*A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or punishments based on its actions. Reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to games, robotics, and self-driving cars, among other applications. Common reinforcement learning algorithms include Q-learning and policy gradients.*
- Thompson Sampling
- Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
